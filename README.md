## Notetaking for the lazy.

I love having notes but I hate taking notes.

This cli takes a prompt and generates a note with ChatGTP based on a `prompt`. A URL can be included to base the note on the content of the url.  

The notes are stored in markdown format in the folder set with `notes_path`.

I use this to create the base notes I then refine in Obsidian.
